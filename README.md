# web-crawler
Web-crawler for search engine

- Note : In order to run this code you need to set the env file with proxy_orbit_key, user_agent and proxy_orbit_url

- you can also run this without proxy but one of the main problems with web crawling and web scraping is that sites will ban you either if you make too many requests, don't use an acceptable user agent, etc..
